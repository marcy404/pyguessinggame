# Welcome to PyGuess! (v1)
## 1. What is PyGuess?
PyGuess is a simple project, with the main goal of me (Oquendo) get back to programming after one year and a half of being a Data Analyst (which uses only SQL 90% of the time). I also want to see where this simple project can get as I add new features and game modes.

For now, only one game mode is available:
1. NumberGuess

## 2. PyGuess' Gamemodes
### NumberGuess
NumberGuess, as the name suggests, is a gamemode where the computer randomly chooses a number (currently only between 1 and 100) and the Player has to guess which number is it. The player has a total of 5 tries and every time they try to guess a number, the computer tells the player if their answer is greater than, less than or equal to the secret.

To exit the game, the player only needs to type "-1" as an answer. Currently, doing this only ends the program.

## 3. Planned features to come up
For NumberGuess:
- User Interface
- Balancing
- Difficulty settings
- Better gameplay/game loop
- Solution algorithms
- PvE/PvP features
