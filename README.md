# Welcome to PyGuess! (v1)
## 1. What is PyGuess?

PyGuess is a simple project, with the main goal of me (Oquendo) get back to programming after one year and a half of being a Data Analyst (which uses only SQL 90% of the time). I also want to see where this simple project can get as I add new features and game modes.

For now, only one game mode is available:
1. NumberGuess


## 2. PyGuess' Gamemodes
### NumberGuess

## 3. Planned features to come up
For NumberGuess:
- User Interface
- Balancing
- Difficulty settings
- Better gameplay/game loop
- Solution algorithms
- PvE/PvP features
